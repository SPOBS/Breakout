# Breakout
A recreation of Atari game Breakout with a few updates that runs on any web browser. 

Created with vanilla JavaScript to learn more about using the canvas element, custom dynamic graphics on web browsers, and a bit of game development.

This was a project I was slowly working on throughout lockdown in 2021 and 2022, only made public recently.

Have fun!
